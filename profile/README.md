## Is this free?

Yes.

## What level of experience is required?

We have various mobs with different skill levels.

## May I join?

Please [schedule a chat with me][schedule].

## How should I prepare for my first session?

1. Test that you have [a recent version of Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and you are able to [compile a dummy project](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html). Tip: installing Rust on Windows takes considerably more time than on other operating systems.
1. Read http://remotemobprogramming.org/.
1. Make a test [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/) call with a friend and use it to test video, audio and screen sharing, entire screen.
1. Install the [mob command line utility](https://mob.sh/).
1. Test that [`git` is set up to authenticate with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).
1. Have something like [direnv] set up in your shell.
1. Configure [two-factor authentication for your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication).
1. [Set up git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).

## I'm a beginner — I'm concerned about having to ask questions frequently.

Please do ask all the questions all the time.

1. Participants benefit greatly from explaining.
   It improves both their own understanding and their communication skills.
1. Every participant finds themselves on the receiving end of explanations at some frequency.
   Some less, some more and this also changes. It's natural.
   If you keep asking, one day you'll find yourself on the answering side.
1. Ask questions early, as opposed to deep into a conversation.
   Don't be shy — interrupt and say "sorry, I lost track of this conversation".

## What is this [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) platform and why are we using it and not [Discord](https://discord.com/) or [Slack](https://slack.com/)?

1. [Read Zulip's answer](https://zulip.com/why-zulip/).
1. It encourages usage of real names.
1. [Zulip's thread-only structure](https://zulip.com/help/streams-and-topics) helps keep track of conversations, whereas in other platforms where threads are optional, they are rarely used consistently.
1. Unlike other platforms [Zulip has decent Markdown support ](https://zulip.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown).
1. [Zulip's free tier](https://zulip.com/plans/) seems considerably more generous than the alternatives.
1. [Zulip is open source](https://github.com/zulip/zulip).
1. Yes, other platforms offer integrated video chat and screen sharing features, but it seems that Jitsi Meet is more satisfactory for our format and it happens to be [integrated by default in Zulip](https://zulip.com/help/start-a-call).

By the way, [Rust uses Zulip, as well](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/).

## May I create new Zulip streams?

Sure, if you feel it's the right thing to do, go ahead.

## Who are you?

I'm Shahar Dawn Or. Call me Dawn. I'm `mightyiam` everywhere.

## May I participate in more than one mob?

Yes, just don't commit to more than you are comfortable with.

## May I create new repositories?

Here's my take on it: for private (non-public) mob activities that consist merely of code,
it seems to me that a single repository that carries the name of the mob would suffice.
Some valid reasons to create a new repository:

1. Making some code public.
1. Using some cloud service that interacts with the repository, such as continuous integration.

## I'd like to support the organizer

## Is Mobus Operandi a pun?

Yes, the name is a pun based on the term 'modus operandi'.
