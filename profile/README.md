# Mobus Operandi

## What

A community for the regular study of [The Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in the format of [Remote Mob Programming](http://remotemobprogramming.org/).

- [Mobus Operandi on The Mob Mentality Show podcast](https://youtu.be/nxNDo-7Fyfk).

## Is this free?

Yes.

## May I join?

Check whether you feel you could fit within any of [these mobs][mobs].
All times are 24h [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time).
Also, take a look in [#schedule suggestions].

If nothing fits, suggest your own schedule in [#schedule suggestions].
Mention your general programming and Rust skill levels.
To improve your chances, also post in [r/ProgrammingBuddies](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingBuddies/).

## What exactly do we study and how?

A recommendation for new rustaceans: [the Exercism Rust track](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust).
Otherwise, it's totally up to you.

## I've found a mob to join. What now?

[Let's have a chat][schedule].

## May I merely spectate?

Possibly. Let's [have a chat][schedule].

## What level of experience is required?

That depends on the specific mob.
See [the list][mobs].

## How should I prepare for my first session?

1. Test that you have [a recent version of Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and you are able to [compile a dummy project](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html). Tip: installing Rust on Windows takes considerably more time than on other operating systems.
1. Read http://remotemobprogramming.org/.
1. Make a test [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/) call with a friend and use it to test video, audio and screen sharing, entire screen.
1. Install the [mob command line utility](https://mob.sh/).
1. Test that [`git` is set up to authenticate with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).
1. Configure [two-factor authentication for your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication).
1. Send [me][mightyiam-zulip] your GitHub user name.

## Are mobs moderated or guided?

Well, I'm the only staff in this young initiative.
I participate only in some of the mobs.
I do my best to introduce each new participant to the mob they are interested in joining.
If anything happened that I should know about, please [let me know][mightyiam-zulip].

## I'm a beginner â€” I'm concerned about having to ask questions frequently.

Please do ask all the questions all the time.

1. Participants benefit greatly from explaining.
   It improves both their own understanding and their communication skills.
1. Every participant finds themselves on the receiving end of explanations at some frequency.
   Some less, some more and this also changes. It's natural.
   If you keep asking then one day you'll find yourself on the explaining side more often.
1. Ask questions early, as opposed to five minutes into a conversation.
   But even if you find yourself five minutes into a conversation, please interrupt it and say "sorry, I lost track of this conversation".
1. It is your responsibility to the mob to keep up by letting them know that you've lost track when you do.

## What is this [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) platform and why are we using it and not [Discord](https://discord.com/) or [Slack](https://slack.com/)?

1. [Read Zulip's answer](https://zulip.com/why-zulip/).
1. It encourages usage of real names.
1. [Zulip's thread-only structure](https://zulip.com/help/streams-and-topics) helps keep track of conversations, whereas in other platforms where threads are optional, they are rarely used consistently.
1. Unlike other platforms [Zulip has decent Markdown support ](https://zulip.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown).
1. [Zulip's free tier](https://zulip.com/plans/) seems considerably more generous than the alternatives.
1. [Zulip is open source](https://github.com/zulip/zulip).
1. Yes, other platforms offer integrated video chat and screen sharing features, but it seems that Jitsi Meet is more satisfactory for our format and it happens to be [integrated by default in Zulip](https://zulip.com/help/start-a-call).

By the way, [Rust uses Zulip, as well](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/).

## May I create new Zulip streams?

Sure, if you feel it's the right thing to do, go ahead.

## Who are you?

I'm Shahar Dawn Or. Call me Dawn. I'm `mightyiam` everywhere.

## May I participate in more than one mob?

Yes, just don't commit to more than you are comfortable with.

## May I create new repositories?

Here's my take on it: for private (non-public) mob activities that consist merely of code,
it seems to me that a single repository that carries the name of the mob would suffice.
Some valid reasons to create a new repository:

1. Making some code public.
1. Using some cloud service that interacts with the repository, such as continuous integration.

## I'd like to support the organizer

[I'm on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mightyiam).

## Any other questions?

Ask in [#general] or message me.

## Is Mobus Operandi a pun?

Yes, the name is a pun based on the term 'modus operandi'.
